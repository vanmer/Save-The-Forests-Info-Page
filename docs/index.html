      <h1>Ten Ways to Preserve Our Forests</h1>
      <article>
        <h2>1. Protect More Ancient Forests</h2>
        <p>
          Eight thousand years ago, large areas of the world were covered with
          ancient forest. As we started to farm, we cut them down for firewood,
          to build houses, and then to make ships, and charcoal for our growing
          industries. Today, as the world’s demand for timber and paper
          continues to grow, almost 80% of the original ancient forests have
          been logged or degraded, and we are losing an additional 13 million
          hectares a year, an area the size of Greece. As we lose the forest, we
          also lose the habitat for many species, including human tribes. We
          must do whatever we can to protect the remaining ancient forest
          worldwide.

        <h2>2. Use Ecoforestry in All Secondary Forests</h2>
        <p>
          In Switzerland, they banned clearcut logging centuries ago, when they
          recognized how it destroyed the soil. Here in Canada, however,
          clearcutting is still practiced quite widely. In 73 countries around
          the world, including Canada, a new standard of socially responsible,
          ecologically sensitive forestry is being embraced by some companies,
          landowners, and First Nations that protects the forests while their
          trees are being harvested, and is certified by the Forest Stewardship
          Council (FSC). With good ecoforestry, the forest will yield more
          timber of higher commercial value over the long term, while protecting
          the forest’s ecosystem.

        <h2>3. Support Your National Forest Strategy</h2>
        <p>
          Canada has a roadmap which can hopefully guide our country’s forestry
          policies, research, and logging practices towards progressive,
          ecosystem-based forest management. It is called the National Forest
          Strategy, and has been developed in true Canadian style with input
          from many stakeholders, including the provinces, environmental groups,
          and First Nations. Every five years, it is updated and renewed. It has
          a brand new “best practices” section, most of which happen to have
          been FSC certified.

        <h2>4. Ban the Import of Illegally Logged Timber</h2>
        <p>
          For every mahogany tree in the tropics that is found and illegally cut
          down, a bulldozer smashes its way through 60 other trees, all for that
          lovely shine that looks so good on the furniture when the guests come
          to visit. Greenpeace estimates that 90% of the timber produced in the
          Amazon is of illegal origin, fuelled by bribes, corruption, and
          intimidation. The World Bank estimates that the global trade in
          illegal timber is worth $15 billion a year, with the US as the largest
          consumer, spending $3.8 billion a year. One of the solutions is to
          develop strong federal legislation, banning its import, to discourage
          illegal logging in forest areas where timber harvesting is strictly
          prohibited.

        <h2>5. Use Less Paper and Wood</h2>
        <p>
          If you buy it, they will log. The more we buy, the more they log. To
          reduce our demand, we can avoid using paper napkins, plates, cups, and
          bags. We can buy paper made from 100% post-consumer recycled paper, or
          from hemp, and be sure to recycle all our waste paper. We can try to
          buy FSC certified wood when we need timber, or seek out recycled
          lumber from house deconstructions. We can remember that wood and paper
          are not just “stuff”: they are made from the living fabric of our
          planet, home to a myriad creatures. 11% of the lumber that is cut each
          year in the US is used to make 400 million wooden pallets, that end up
          in bonfires or in the landfill. That much timber could build 300,000
          houses. We should ban all wood waste from our landfills, and encourage
          the careful deconstruction of unwanted houses, instead of demolition.

        <h2>6. Eat Less Beef</h2>
        <p>
          North America’s insistent demand for hamburgers, steak, and dog food
          sends a very clear message to the farmers of Central America, and
          Brazil, who clear the forest to make way for their cattle ranches. In
          Brazil’s Amazon rainforest, for every cow, 2.5 acres of forest
          disappear; for every quarter pound hamburger from a cleared
          rainforest, fifty-five square feet of rainforest is destroyed. A
          vegan, who eats no meat, fish, or dairy products, needs 1/6th of an
          acre for his or her annual food needs. A vegetarian needs half an
          acre. A meat-eater needs three acres, and increasingly, some of this
          comes from cleared rainforests. We can scoff our steaks, or we can
          keep our rainforests; but it seems we can’t have both.

        <h2>7. Invest in Rainforest Communities</h2>
        <p>
          Nearly 17% of the Amazon rainforest has been deforested, and forest
          scientists are saying that if it reaches a 40% level of deforestation,
          the forest will enter a process of desertification that is
          irreversible. The Rainforest Action Network, based in San Francisco,
          has a “Protect-an-Acre” program which provides funding to help forest
          peoples gain legal recognition of their territories. It also helps
          them to develop locally-based economic alternatives, and resist
          intrusions by the loggers and oil companies, who are after their land.
          This is a very specific initiative that you can support now, that will
          have a specific impact.

        <h2>8. Support the Activists</h2>
        <p>
          In 1993, when the BC government announced that it would allow forest
          companies to log 62% of the forest in Clayoquot Sound, on the west
          coast of Vancouver Island, there was such an uproar that 12,000
          citizens attended a summer long road blockade, and 850 people were
          arrested for peaceful civil disobedience. The protests worked, though
          not fully; the government backed off, and endorsed an ecosystem-based
          approach that has reduced the amount of logging taking place. Without
          activism, nothing happens. The destructive logging continues, and the
          world’s forests continue to fall.

        <h2>9. Act on the Solutions to Global Climate Change</h2>
        <p>
          What’s climate change got to do with the forests? Everything, alas. In
          central British Columbia, the mountain pine beetle is completely out
          of control, because its larvae are putting on suntan oil in winter,
          instead of dying. In the Amazon, climate scientists fear that the
          forest will begin to dry out by 2040, due to changes in ocean
          temperatures which will alter the normal storm tracks. When the
          forests can no longer store carbon, we’ve got an even greater climate
          problem. In other words, if we want to protect the Earth’s forests, we
          must take climate change extremely seriously, both personally,
          nationally, and globally.

        <h2>10. Act on the Solutions to Global Poverty</h2>
        <p>
          Here’s the problem. Injes Juma and his friends are poor, illiterate,
          and they’ve got families to feed. They live in Malawi, where the
          forest is full of 30 foot tall masuku trees. A whole tree, if they
          fell it and cut it into logs, will bring 2,000 kwacha ($18) for sale
          as firewood or charcoal. “We have no money to raise our families. We
          have nowhere to run, nothing else to do. So we have to cut the trees
          to feed our families.” Two thirds of Malawi’s people earn less than a
          dollar a day. Malawi, like so many developing countries, needs a
          comprehensive new deal. It needs an end to its $3 billion debt, the
          repayment of which devours 21% of the government’s income. It needs an
          end to corruption. It needs land reform, support for local
          agriculture, microlending schemes, sustainable forest businesses, and
          all the other initiatives that can make a difference. We can’t turn
          our backs on countries like Malawi, and expect the forest to survive.
          It’s all tied together.
